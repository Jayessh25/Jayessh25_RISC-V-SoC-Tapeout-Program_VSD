Welcome to **Day 1** of the RTL Workshop!  
Today, you'll dive into **Verilog RTL design**, **open-source simulation with Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, and **logic synthesis using Yosys**. This guide walks through labs, essential concepts, and practical exercises to build a strong RTL foundation.

## 1. Simulator, Design, and Testbench

### Simulator
A **simulator** checks your digital circuitâ€™s functionality by applying test inputs and observing outputs, helping verify designs before hardware implementation.

### Design
The **design** is your Verilog code describing the intended logic.

### Testbench
A **testbench** applies inputs to your design and checks outputs for correctness.

## 2. Getting Started with iverilog

**iverilog** is an open-source Verilog simulator. Typical workflow:

- Provide design and testbench as input.  
- Generates `.vcd` waveform file for GTKWave.
